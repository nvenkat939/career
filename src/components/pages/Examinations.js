      <img src={ImagSrc} alt="advanced" />
      <p>
      Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced (JEE-Advanced) (formerly the Indian Institute of Technology - Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE)), is an academic examination held annually in India. It is organised by one of the seven zonal IITs (IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati) under the guidance of the Joint Admission Board (JAB) on a round-robin rotation pattern for the qualifying candidates of the JEE-Main (exempted for Foreign Candidates). It used to be the sole prerequisite for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology bachelor's programs before the introduction of UCEED, Online B.S. and Olympiad entries, but seats through these new mediums are very low or difficult to complete the course.
      JEE(Advanced) is conducted in two shifts of three hours each - Paper-1 and Paper-2, both the papers consist questions from three major subjects- Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Unlike most of the other exams, the type and the number of questions being asked in the paper varies from year to year, with an average of about 36-38 questions asked from each subject across both the shifts, For example, the 2021 JEE Advanced paper had 38 questions (19 questions in Paper-1 and the next 19 in Paper-2) from each of the three subjects.

Every subject had questions divided into 4 main sections-
1. Section 1 consisted of 4 Single correct-multiple choice questions with marking scheme of +4 for every correct answer, 0 if question is left unanswered and -1 for every wrong answer.

2. Section 2 consisted of Three question stems with 2 questions per stem, each of which had a numerical answer with two decimal places. Marking scheme for the questions was +2 for every correct answer and 0 in all other cases.

3. Section 3 consisted of 6 Multi correct- multiple choice questions, where one or more than one options for each question were correct. It had a marking scheme of +4 If only (all) the correct option(s) is(are) chosen; +3 If all the four options are correct but only three options are chosen; +2 If three or more options are correct but only two options are chosen, both of which are correct; +1 If two or more options are correct but only one option is chosen and it is a correct option; 0 If unanswered; while a −2 was given for every wrong one chosen.

4. Section 4 consisted of 3 questions whose answers where ‘non-negative integers’, every question carried a +4 for correct integer filled and 0 for all the other cases.
